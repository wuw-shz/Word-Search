## Features

- **Typeahead Suggestions**: Receive typeahead suggestions as you type in the search bar, aiding in finding words efficiently.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a React component (`App.tsx`) responsible for the main functionality of the English Words Searcher application. Here's a brief overview:

- **Search Engine**: The `searchEngine` function utilizes a regular expression to perform a case-insensitive search for words in a text file (`words.txt`). It filters the words based on the search query and whether they are valid English words.
- **User Interface**: The UI consists of an input field for entering the search query, radio buttons for toggling between showing all results or a limited number of results, and a list to display the search results.
- **List Rendering**: The search results are displayed using the `FixedSizeList` component from the `react-window` library, providing efficient rendering of a large number of items.
